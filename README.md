# HANDS-ON REACT

```sh
git checkout step-2
```

## Step 2

- components **props**
- props **validation**
- component lists

### Step 2.A

You have an example of how to define required component props in `Header.jsx`,
and how they're passed to it in `App.jsx`.
Change **Footer** component to make it configurable via props.

### Step 2.B

You'll see the **Controls** component now uses a loop to generate each button.
Change **PackageList** component in order to use a loop to generate each list item.
